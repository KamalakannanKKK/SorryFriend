    <p>Hey Sarkar,</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m reaching out because I feel the need to share something with you. Right now, Iâ€™m in a mindset where I donâ€™t feel like speaking to anyone else. Honestly, Iâ€™ve decided that I wonâ€™t be stepping out or engaging with others, no matter what happens.</p>
    <p>But with you, itâ€™s different. I want you alone to talk to me. It feels like my mind gets blocked if I donâ€™t have that connection with you. So, please, speak with me.</p>
    <p>I am also planning not to come to office on Monday, wednesday and Friday. I will take WFH on those days. you may think why this fellow
    telling this things to me. I just want to tell to you, so i'm telling this. I am not thinking about others what they will think...</p>
    <p>Our brother-sister bond means so much to me, and I just want to make things right. Sorry for Everything if i am wrong....</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Always your brother.</h3>
